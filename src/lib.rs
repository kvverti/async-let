//! This crate implements async-let as a `#[no_std]`, no-unsafe, no-panic, minimal-overhead library.
//!
//! Async-let is an experiment based on Conrad Ludgate's musings from <https://conradludgate.com/posts/async-let>,
//! which proposes a syntax that allows futures to be run "in the background" without spawning additional tasks.
//! The general behavior of async-let is that the following (fictitious) syntax
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async let metadata = client.request_metadata();
//! ```
//!
//! will mark a future as a background future. Any await point between the binding and `data.await` will poll
//! `data` as well as the future being awaited.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // `metadata` is marked as a background future here
//! async let metadata = client.request_metadata();
//!
//! // both `data` and `metadata` are polled while awaiting `data`
//! let data = client.request_data().await;
//!
//! // unmark `metadata` as a background future and await it
//! let metadata = metadata.await;
//! ```
//!
//! Using this crate's API, the above can be written like this.
//!
//! ```
//! # use core::pin::pin;
//! # struct Client;
//! # impl Client {
//! #   async fn request_metadata(&self) {}
//! #   async fn request_data(&self) {}
//! # }
//! # let client = Client;
//! # pollster::block_on(async move {
//! // create a group that will drive the background futures
//! let group = async_let::Group::new();
//!
//! // mark `metadata` as a background future by attaching it to the group
//! let metadata = pin!(client.request_metadata());
//! let (metadata, mut group) = group.attach(metadata);
//!
//! // await `data` using the group, which polls the background futures
//! let data = group.wait_for(client.request_data()).await;
//!
//! // detach `metadata` from the group and await it
//! let (metadata, group) = group.detach_and_wait_for(metadata).await;
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! ## API
//! The main types this crate offers are [`Group<List>`], a type that manages manages driving a statically typed
//! `List` of background futures; and [`Handle<Fut>`], an abstract handle that represents the capability to extract
//! a background future of type `Fut`. The [`attach`] method adds a future to the list of background futures, the
//! [`detach`] method removes a future, and the [`wait_for`] method produces a future that will poll the background
//! futures when it is polled.
//!
//! To minimize the overhead of tracking background futures, each `Group` is associated with a fixed set of futures.
//! Attaching a future to a group or detaching a future from a group consumes the group and produces a new group with
//! the future added to or removed from the set of background futures, respectively.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//! In the quest for minimal overhead, several tradeoffs were made.
//! - **Ergonomics**: while the API was made to be as ergonomic as possible, callers are still required to manually add and
//!   remove futures, thread the group through each operation, and locally pin futures explicitly.
//! - **Pinning**: Because a group stores its list of futures inline, the stored futures must be `Unpin`. Futures that require
//!   pinning must be stored behind an indirection, such as with `pin!` or `Box::pin`.
//! - **Lifetimes**: a group is necessarily moved when a future is attached or detached. If a future is attached in a nested
//!   scope, it must be detached before leaving that scope, or else the group (and all its attached futures) will be made
//!   inaccessible.
//! - **Branching**: because the set of futures is statically tracked, it is not possible to attach a future in only one branch
//!   of a condtional if one wishes the group to remain accessible after the conditional. Futures of different types may
//!   be attached to the same location in a group by erasing the type of the attached future to `dyn Future<Output = X>`,
//!   but this has its limitations.
//!
//! [`attach`]: Group::attach
//! [`detach`]: Group::detach
//! [`wait_for`]: Group::wait_for
